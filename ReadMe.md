<h1>sliding puzzle game</h1><br>
<p>A puzzle is a type of game that requires mental or physical effort. A sliding puzzle is a type of puzzle that requires the player to slide pieces into grooves on a board. There are many different types of sliding puzzles. One problem with this genre is that players can become physically or mentally fatigued while playing. That's why there are strict rules and guidelines for how people play slide puzzles.

A sliding puzzle is an exciting game, as the name suggests. The board is placed on a table or other smooth surface and has many vertical and horizontal slots. The slots are sized to fit different pieces, such as squares, triangles, circles, and other shapes. Players then slide these pieces into the slots in order to complete the jigsaw puzzle. This activity can be done alone or with others as a group. It can also be done at a place such as a caf√© or a restaurant where people have time to relax and enjoy themselves.

Players may need to move their bodies while playing slide puzzles. A person must stand upright while sliding the pieces into place on the board. This makes it difficult for them to put their feet on the table while playing. Additionally, people must keep their fingers and hands loose and relaxed as they slide the pieces around the board. This prevents fatigue from affecting their grip and control over the puzzle pieces. Sliding puzzles also cause your eyes to move frequently as you follow the path of each piece from start to finish.

There are a lot of different types of slide puzzles. For example, you can play a Sudoku puzzle where each number has its own unique space on the board. Or you can play anagrams where each letter must appear in each word correctly formed by the letters in that word. Other standard puzzles include shape sorters, scrambled eggs, mazes, and jigsaws, where you must put together a picture from fragments scattered throughout a box-shaped structure.

Aside from physical fatigue, sliding puzzles can also make your eyes tired. People often play these games in their leisure time or in places where they don't have to worry about getting things done quickly. However, it's essential to know when to stop playing any kind of game, as these activities can make you tired and less able to function normally when you're done.
<br> playing this game is very easy all a player needs to do is to move the slots with the arrow keys and then if it matches the time counter stops. To restart or reset pressing R is the player has to do.
